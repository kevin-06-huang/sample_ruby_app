# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# as per listing 6.29, to address a uniqueness constraint issue in the
# fixtures, which is preventing our automatic software suite from
# passing, we commented this out and leave it empty for now until later

#one:
#  name: MyString
#  email: MyString

#two:
#  name: MyString
#  email: MyString
# as per listing 8.19, after we've defined a class method for computing
# password_digest from password, we now define a fixture for placement
# in the database for testing user login; also note that fixtures allow
# the use of embedded ruby
test:
  name: Test
  email: test@example.com
  password_digest: <%= User.digest('password') %>
  # added in 9.4.3 to make the first user an admin in order to test user
  # destroy action
  admin: true
# a fixture is retrieved and used inside a test as follows:
# user = users(:test)
# here, users is the filename of the yml, and :test references the key
# in the fixture above
  # we add this part in listing 10.5 to activate fixture users, since we
  # have added user activation
  activated: true
  activated_at: <%= Time.zone.now %>

# this is added in 9.2.2, from listing 9.20; it is added to have a second
# test user in order to test for certain actions such as edit requiring
# the correct user to be logged in
test2:
  name: Test2
  email: test2@gmail.com
  password_digest: <%= User.digest('password') %>
  activated: true
  activated_at: <%= Time.zone.now %>
  
# this is added in listing 9.43, and generates 30 extra users to fixture
# to test pagination; a few extra named users are also defined for use in
# the test. This also shows how we can use embedded ruby in yml
