# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# as per listing 6.29, to address a uniqueness constraint issue in the
# fixtures, which is preventing our automatic software suite from
# passing, we commented this out and leave it empty for now until later

#one:
#  name: MyString
#  email: MyString

#two:
#  name: MyString
#  email: MyString
# as per listing 8.19, after we've defined a class method for computing
# password_digest from password, we now define a fixture for placement
# in the database for testing user login; also note that fixtures allow
# the use of embedded ruby
test:
  name: Test
  email: test@example.com
  password_digest: <%= User.digest('foobar') %>
# a fixture is retrieved and used inside a test as follows:
# user = users(:test)
# here, users is the filename of the yml, and :test references the key
# in the fixture above
